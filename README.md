# unit-4-game
In this assignment we were to create a Gem game where a random target number and 4 gems with a random value are generated.  The user then tries to figure out what each gem is worth and tries to get those values to add up to without going over the target value.  If your number is below the target number you keep playing, if you go over the target number you lose, and if your number equals the target number you win.
